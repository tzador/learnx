## 01. Introduction to Python Advanced

Welcome to the "Python Advanced" series! Here, we will delve deeper into
Python's more sophisticated features. Whether you're looking to sharpen
your coding skills, tackle complex problems, or understand the internals
of Python, this series is for you.

We'll start with foundational advanced concepts like iterators,
generators, and decorators, moving towards more intricate topics like
context managers, metaclasses, and asynchronous programming. Each article
will build upon the last, ensuring a comprehensive understanding.

Make sure to have a basic grasp of Python as we'll be moving quickly
through the material. Let's embark on this exciting journey into Python's
advanced capabilities! Stay tuned for the next article where we'll
explore iterators and iterables.

## 02. Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows a user to modify
functions or methods. They are essentially functions that return another
function. This ability to wrap a function allows you to add functionality
to an existing code in a clean and Pythonic way. Decorators are commonly
used for logging, authentication, and monitoring purposes.

### Basic Syntax

In Python, a decorator is indicated by `@decorator_name` above the function
that is to be decorated. For example:

```python
@my_decorator
def my_function():
    pass
```

### Creating a Simple Decorator

Let's create a simple decorator that prints the arguments and results of
a function call:

```python
def logger(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} called with {args}, {kwargs}")
        print(f"Result: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@logger
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

result = sum(2, 3)
```

This will print:

```
Function sum called with (2, 3), {}
Result: 5
```

By understanding and utilizing decorators, you can greatly enhance the
maintainability and flexibility of your code.

## 03. Context Managers

Context managers are a powerful feature in Python for managing resources.
They allow a user to allocate and release resources precisely
when needed. The most common use case is opening and closing files.

### Basic Context Manager Using `with`

The `with` statement ensures that resources are properly cleaned up
after use, reducing potential bugs and resource leaks.

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
    # File is closed automatically
```

In the above example, `file` is automatically closed after the block
of code within the `with` statement is executed, even if an error
occurs within the block.

### Creating Custom Context Managers

To create a custom context manager, you can define a class with
`__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting context")

with MyContextManager() as manager:
    print("Inside context")
```

This will output:

```
Entering context
Inside context
Exiting context
```

The `__enter__` method is executed at the beginning of the
`with` block, while `__exit__` is executed at the end.

## 04. Generators

Generators provide an elegant way to iterate over data in Python
without holding the entire dataset in memory. They are commonly used
when dealing with large collections of data, where it's impractical
to load everything at once.

A generator is a special type of iterator that uses the `yield`
statement to produce a series of values over time. Each call to the
generator’s `next()` method resumes its execution from where it
left off (following the last `yield` statement) and runs until it
hits another `yield` or reaches the end of the function.

### Creating a Generator

A generator can be created in two ways: using a generator function
or a generator expression.

#### Generator Function

A generator function uses one or more `yield` statements to produce
a sequence of results. Here is an example:

```python
 def count_up_to(max):
 count = 1
 while count <= max:
 yield count
 count += 1
```

#### Generator Expression

Generator expressions provide a concise way to create generators.
They are similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses:

```python
 squares = (x * x for x in range(10))
```

### Advantages of Generators

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Generators compute values lazily, which
   means they only produce items one at a time and don’t store
   the entire dataset in memory.
2. **Improved Performance**: Since data isn't stored in memory,
   they can increase performance by reducing memory usage.
3. **Facilitate Iteration**: Simplify complex iteration patterns.

### Example Usage

Here's how you might use a generator:

```python
 def fibonacci(n):
 a, b = 0, 1
 while a < n:
 yield a
 a, b = b, a + b

 fib_gen = fibonacci(10)
 for number in fib_gen:
 print(number)
```

In this example, the generator yields the Fibonacci sequence up to
before the number `10`. Each call to `next(fib_gen)` retrieves the
next number in the sequence.

## 05. Metaclasses

In Python, metaclasses are a complex, yet powerful concept.
They serve as the "classes of classes", meaning that they can
be thought of as the blueprint for classes themselves.
Metaclasses define how classes behave and can be used to
automate class creation, enforce certain rules, or modify class
behavior.

### Defining a Metaclass

A metaclass is defined by inheriting from the `type` class. The
most common method to override is `__new__`, which allows you
to control how the class is instantiated.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
```

### Using a Metaclass

To use a metaclass, specify it with the `metaclass` keyword when
defining a class:

```python
class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
```

When `MyClass` is created, the `Meta` metaclass will be used,
which will trigger any custom logic defined in `Meta.**new**.

### Practical Applications

Metaclasses can enforce consistent coding practices or
register classes automatically. For example, they are commonly
used in frameworks to ensure that certain attributes or methods
exist in classes.

In summary, while metaclasses might not be necessary daily,
they offer deep customization and automation capabilities
in Python's object model.

## 06. Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming

In Python, while generators allow for asynchronous operations, coroutines
extend that idea to also allow routines to be interrupted and resumed, making
them suitable for concurrent programming tasks.

### Understanding Coroutines

Coroutines are a kind of generator function that allows for input, which makes
them both more powerful and more complex. Coroutines are defined using the
`async def` syntax, and you can start them with the `await` keyword.

Here’s a basic example of a coroutine:

```python
async def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### The Event Loop

To run coroutines, Python provides an event loop. This loop keeps track of all
the different tasks that need to be run and decides when to run each task.

#### Example with Asyncio

The `asyncio` module is Python's standard library for writing asynchronous
applications. Here’s a simple example to show how you can use the module to
run coroutines:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    await greet('Alice')
    await greet('Bob')

asyncio.run(main())
```

When using `async def` functions, the `await` keyword is used to call other
asynchronous functions. The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the
function until the awaited coroutine finishes executing.

### Using Asyncio for Concurrency

Python’s asyncio is designed to handle I/O-bound and high-level structured
network code. With the asyncio module, you can scale your code to handle
multiple I/O-intensive tasks concurrently using a single-threaded model.

Here’s an example of a coroutine that retrieves web pages concurrently:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_page(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main(urls):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_page(session, url) for url in urls]
        pages = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        for page in pages:
            print(page)

urls = ['https://example.com', 'https://python.org']

asyncio.run(main(urls))
```

In this example, we use the `aiohttp` library to handle HTTP requests
asynchronously, vastly improving the efficiency when working with numerous
I/O-bound tasks.

Coroutines provide a powerful way to tackle the complexity of concurrent
programming, allowing Python developers to handle asynchronous tasks with ease,
thus enhancing performance and scalability.

## 07. Descriptors

Descriptors are a powerful but often overlooked feature in Python.
They allow for custom behavior when accessing, setting, or deleting
an attribute on an object. Descriptors are implemented as objects
that define any or all of the following methods: `__get__`, `__set__`,
and `__delete__`.

### The Basics

A descriptor class must at least define the `__get__` method. Here's a
simple example of a read-only descriptor:

```python
class ReadOnly:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        return "This is a read-only attribute"
```

In this example, whenever an attribute using this descriptor is
accessed, it returns a predefined string.

### Working with Descriptors

Descriptors are commonly used in the implementation of properties
in Python. When you use the `@property` decorator on a method, it
creates a descriptor. More complex descriptors might be needed for
use-cases like managing attributes or implementing lazy evaluation.

### Practical Example

Here's a more practical example of a descriptor managing a value
with validation:

```python
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32

class Temperature:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        return instance.__dict__[self.name]

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273 is not possible")
        instance.__dict__[self.name] = value

class Weather:
    temperature = Temperature('temperature')

weather = Weather()
weather.temperature = 37
print(weather.temperature)  # Output: 37
```

In this example, the `Temperature` descriptor is used to enforce
validation. It raises an exception if the temperature is below
absolute zero. Descriptors provide flexibility in controlling access
and modifying attribute behavior in Python and are crucial for
architecting clean, efficient code structures.

## 08. Concurrent Programming with Threads and Multiprocessing

Concurrent programming is all about executing multiple processes or threads
simultaneously to improve the performance of a program. In Python, the ability to run
multiple threads or processes in parallel can greatly enhance productivity,
especially in CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks.

### Threads in Python

Threads in Python can be implemented using the `threading` module. This module
provides a high-level interface for threading, which allows you to run separate
parts of code concurrently. However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
restricts execution of multiple threads at once within a single process, which can
limit CPU-bound tasks.

Here's a simple example of using threads:

```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Number: {i}')

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

In this example, the `print_numbers` function runs in a separate thread, allowing
it to execute concurrently with the main program.

### Multiprocessing in Python

For CPU-bound tasks, Python provides the `multiprocessing` module, which offers
true parallelism by using multiple processes. Unlike threads, each process has
its own Python interpreter and memory space, so it's not affected by the GIL.

Here's a basic use case of the `multiprocessing` module:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f'Number: {i}')

process = Process(target=print_numbers)
process.start()
process.join()
```

This example is similar to threading, but it uses a separate process to run the
`print_numbers` function.

### Choosing Between Threads and Processes

When deciding between threads and processes, consider the type of task:

- Use **threads** for I/O-bound tasks, such as web scraping or reading files.
- Use **processes** for CPU-bound tasks, such as computational calculations.

Both threading and multiprocessing have their strengths and trade-offs, so the
right choice depends on the specific needs of your application.

#### Conclusion

Understanding how to implement concurrent programming with threads and
multiprocessing in Python allows for more efficient and effective code execution,
especially in complex programs that require multitasking. It enables developers to
overcome limitations associated with single-thread execution and to leverage
system resources more effectively.

## 09. Itertools and Functional Programming

In the world of Python, the `itertools` module provides a set of tools for
functional programming. It allows for efficient looping and combines features to
support data accumulation and computation.

### itertools Module

The `itertools` module offers various iterations. Some of these include:

- **Infinite Iterators:** Functions like `count()`, `cycle()`, and `repeat()`
  generate infinite sequences of data.

- **Finite Iterators:** Provide operations like `chain()`, `compress()`,
  `dropwhile()`, `islice()`, etc., to perform higher-order operations.

- **Combinatoric Iterators:** These include functions like `product()`,
  `permutations()`, and `combinations()`.

#### Example: Infinite Iterators

The `count()` function can create endless iterations over numbers:

```python
from itertools import count

for n in count(10, 2):  # Start at ten, step by two
    if n > 20:
        break
    print(n)
```

#### Example: Combinatoric Iterators

Generate permutations using `permutations()`:

```python
from itertools import permutations

for p in permutations('ABC', 2):
    print(p)
```

The output will be:

```
('A', 'B')
('A', 'C')
('B', 'A')
('B', 'C')
('C', 'A')
('C', 'B')
```

These utilities provide powerful constructs for complex tasks. When combined
with generator expressions, they deliver efficient memory usage and versatile
iteration strategies. Mastery of these tools enables more Pythonic solutions
in functional programming paradigms.

## 10. Regular Expressions in Python

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for matching patterns in
strings. In Python, the `re` module is used to work with regex.

### Basics

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you
match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized
syntax. Here are some fundamental symbols:

- `.` - Matches any character except newline
- `^` - Matches the start of the string
- `$` - Matches the end of the string

#### Special Sequences

- `\d` - Matches any digit, equivalent to `[0-9]`
- `\D` - Matches any non-digit
- `\w` - Matches any alphanumeric character
- `\W` - Matches any non-alphanumeric character
- `\s` - Matches any whitespace character
- `\S` - Matches any non-whitespace character

#### Repetition Qualifiers

- `*` - 0 or more repetitions
- `+` - 1 or more repetitions
- `?` - 0 or 1 repetition
- `{n}` - Exactly n repetitions
- `{n,}` - n or more repetitions
- `{n,m}` - Between n and m repetitions

#### Grouping

Parentheses `()` are used for grouping parts of patterns, allowing
regex to apply quantifiers to the group.

### Using the `re` Module

The `re` module offers a set of functions:

- `re.match()` - Determines if the regex matches at the start of a string
- `re.search()` - Scans through a string, looking for the first match
- `re.findall()` - Finds all the matches of a pattern in a string
- `re.finditer()` - Returns an iterator yielding match objects
- `re.sub()` - Replaces occurrences of a pattern with a string

#### Example

```python
import re

text = "The rain in Spain"
pattern = r"\bS\w+"
result = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(result)  # Output: ['Spain']
```

This example searches for words starting with 'S'. The `\b` denotes a
word boundary.

Understanding and using regular expressions require practice but provide
immense power to text processing tasks in Python.

## 11. Memory Management in Python

Python has an efficient memory management system that supports
automatic garbage collection. Understanding how memory is managed
can enhance your coding efficiency and help you avoid memory leaks.

### Memory Allocation

Python has its own garbage collector, which handles memory allocation
and deallocation. When memory is no longer used, it will be
automatically freed by the garbage collector.

- **Reference Counting**: Python uses reference counting for memory
  management. Each object keeps track of the number of references to it,
  and once an object has no references, it is garbage collected.

- **Garbage Collection**: Apart from reference counting, Python's
  garbage collector can detect and clean up cyclic references, which
  reference counting alone cannot detect.

### Memory Management Techniques

- **Avoiding Circular References**: Avoid creating objects that reference
  each other. Use weak references if necessary.

- **Using Generators**: Generators consume less memory and are
  preferable for large data sets.

- **The `gc` Module**: You can control the garbage collector with this
  module. For example, you might need to manually collect garbage
  if you suspect memory leaks.

- **Profiling memory usage**: Use tools like `memory_profiler` and
  `objgraph` to track where memory is being used.

Understanding and managing memory in Python can lead to optimized
and robust applications, especially in environments with limited
resources.

## 12. Python C Extensions

In some scenarios, Python may not provide the necessary performance for
certain tasks, such as numerical computations or real-time processing.
This is where Python C Extensions come into play. Python C Extensions
allow developers to write code in C, which can then be called from
Python. This combination takes advantage of the speed of C while
enjoying the simplicity and flexibility of Python.

### Creating a Simple C Extension

A basic C extension consists of a C source code file and a setup script.
Let's create a simple example:

#### Step 1: Write the C Code

Create a file named `example.c` with the following content:

```c
##include <Python.h>

static PyObject* example_sum(PyObject* self, PyObject* args) {
    int a, b;
    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ii", &a, &b)) {
        return NULL;
    }
    return PyLong_FromLong(a + b);
}

static PyMethodDef ExampleMethods[] = {
    {"sum", example_sum, METH_VARARGS, "Adds two numbers."},
    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
};

static struct PyModuleDef examplemodule = {
    PyModuleDef_HEAD_INIT, "example", NULL, -1, ExampleMethods
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_example(void) {
    return PyModule_Create(&examplemodule);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Setup Script

Create a file named `setup.py` with the contents:

```python
from setuptools import setup, Extension

setup(name='example',
      version='1.0',
      ext_modules=[Extension('example', ['example.c'])])
```

#### Step 3: Build the Extension

Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python setup.py build
```

#### Step 4: Use the Extension in Python

Install the built extension and import it in Python as follows:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

Then, use it in a Python script:

```python
import example
print(example.sum(3, 4))  # Outputs: 7
```

### Benefits of C Extensions

- **Performance**: Significantly faster execution for computational
  heavy tasks.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration between Python and C.
- **Reuse**: Use existing C libraries in Python scripts.

While building Python C Extensions might seem challenging initially,
understanding and utilizing them can lead to performance optimization
in Python applications.

## 13. Network Programming with Python

Network programming is a vital skill in today's interconnected world, and Python
provides powerful libraries for handling protocols, managing network resources,
and building network applications.

### Sockets

Sockets are the foundation of network communication. Python's `socket` module
provides access to the BSD socket interface. You can create both TCP and UDP
clients and servers using this module.

Example of a basic TCP server:

```python
import socket

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8080))
server_socket.listen()

while True:
    client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
    message = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print(f"Received message: {message}")
    client_socket.sendall(b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nHello, World!")
    client_socket.close()
```

### HTTP Clients

Python provides high-level modules such as `requests` for communicating over
HTTP. The `requests` library simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests.

Example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')
print(response.status_code)
```

### Async IO

With the `asyncio` module, Python can manage asynchronous operations easily,
which is beneficial for IO-bound network applications.

Example of an asynchronous network client:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    reader, writer = await asyncio.open_connection('example.com', 80)
    writer.write(b'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n')
    await writer.drain()

    data = await reader.read(1024)
    print(f'Received: {data.decode()}')

    writer.close()
    await writer.wait_closed()

asyncio.run(fetch_data())
```

These examples illustrate Python's efficiency in managing both low-level socket
operations and higher-level HTTP requests, along with complementing async
network operations.

## 14. Python's Data Model and Magic Methods

Python's data model is a powerful framework that allows developers
create custom objects or classes with special behavior. This is done
by leveraging "magic methods", also known as "dunder (double
underscore) methods", which customize the behavior of Python
operators and internal mechanisms.

### Understanding Magic Methods

Magic methods are pre-defined special methods you can implement to
overload operations for custom classes. They enable object behavior
to mimic built-in types. These methods start and end with a double
underscore, for example, `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__add__`.

#### Common Magic Methods

1. **`__init__(self, ...)`**: Initializes a new instance of a class.
2. **`__str__(self)`**: Defines the string representation for an
   instance, used by the `str()` function.
3. **`__repr__(self)`**: Offers a detailed string representation,
   generally used for debugging.
4. **`__add__(self, other)`**: Overloads the `+` operator.
5. **`__len__(self)`**: Overloads the `len()` function when applied
   to an instance.
6. **`__getitem__(self, key)`**: Allows for indexing, e.g., `obj[key]`.

#### Implementing Custom Magic Methods

To define how instances of your class should behave with operators
or built-in functions, you specify the corresponding magic method.
For example, implementing `__add__` could look like this:

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
```

This code snippet defines how a `Vector` instance reacts when the
`+` operator is used, adding x and y components respectively.

### The Power of Magic Methods

Magic methods allow custom objects to blend seamlessly with Python's
idioms and syntax, making them a core feature of Python's design.
They permit the use of expressive and intuitive syntax when
interacting with user-defined classes and can be implemented for a
range of behaviors including arithmetic operations, attribute
access, and type conversion. Such customization can make a class
more readable and maintainable.

In conclusion, by using Python's data model and magic methods, one
can unlock advanced customization capabilities, enhancing both the
functionality and usability of your Python classes.

## 15. Advanced Logging and Debugging

Logging and debugging are essential for diagnosing and resolving
issues in Python programs. Python's `logging` module provides
a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.
In this article, we will delve into more advanced techniques
for logging and debugging in Python.

### Logging Configuration

To set up complex logging configurations, you can use logging
configuration files. Here's an example:

```python
import logging.config

logging_config = {
    'version': 1,
    'formatters': {
        'detailed': {
            'format': '%(asctime)s %(name)-15s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'
        },
        'simple': {
            'format': '%(levelname)s: %(message)s'
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            'formatter': 'simple',
        },
        'file': {
            'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
            'filename': 'app.log',
            'formatter': 'detailed',
        },
    },
    'root': {
        'handlers': ['console', 'file'],
        'level': 'DEBUG',
    },
}

logging.config.dictConfig(logging_config)
logger = logging.getLogger("my_app")
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
```

Using configuration dictionaries, you can easily manage multiple
loggers and handlers, each with its own format and destination.

### Adding Context to Logs

Including additional context with each log message helps in
understanding the logs better. You can leverage
`ThreadLocal` or log adapters for this purpose:

```python
import logging
import threading

class ContextFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        record.clientip = threading.local().clientip
        record.user = threading.local().user
        return True

logger.addFilter(ContextFilter())
threading.local().clientip = '192.0.2.1'
threading.local().user = 'jdoe'
logger.info('User login')
```

### Debugging with `pdb`

Python Debugger (`pdb`) is a powerful tool for inspecting code
execution interactively. To set a breakpoint, insert:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Run your script, and execution will pause, opening an
interactive command line for inspecting variables and step
through the code.

#### Postmortem Debugging

For debugging after an exception occurs:

```python
import pdb
import sys

try:
    # Some code that may throw an exception
    pass
except:
    # Enter postmortem debugging
    _, _, tb = sys.exc_info()
    pdb.post_mortem(tb)
```

This approach allows you to explore the state of the program
at the point where an uncaught exception was raised.

Combining logging with advanced debugging techniques enhances
your ability to track down bugs and monitor the health of your
applications effectively. Utilizing context, configuration, and
postmortem capabilities allows developers to keep a detailed and
analysis-friendly record of what happens inside their code.

## 16. Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are typical solutions to recurring problems in software
architecture. This article focuses on how Python implements these patterns.
Python's dynamic nature allows for simplified implementations of design
patterns that are verbose in other languages.

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a
global point of access to it. In Python, a simple way to implement singleton
is using a module. Since modules are singletons by nature, this provides
a straightforward way:

```python

class Singleton:
    def __new__(cls):
        if not hasattr(cls, 'instance'):
            cls.instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls.instance
```

### Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact
class of object that will be created. Python's ability to handle functions
as first-class objects makes implementing a factory pattern straightforward.

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class AnimalFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_animal(animal_type):
        if animal_type == "dog":
            return Dog()
        elif animal_type == "cat":
            return Cat()
        else:
            return None
```

Usage of the factory:

```python
animal = AnimalFactory.get_animal("dog")
print(animal.speak())  # Output: Woof!
```

### Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
automatically.

In Python, you can employ decorators and built-in functions like `property`
to implement this pattern.

```python
class Observer:
    def update(self, change):
        print("Observer received change:", change)

class Observable:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []

    def add_observer(self, observer):
        if observer not in self._observers:
            self._observers.append(observer)

    def remove_observer(self, observer):
        if observer in self._observers:
            self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify_observers(self, value):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(value)

observable = Observable()
observer1 = Observer()
observable.add_observer(observer1)
observable.notify_observers("Update 1")
```

Understanding these patterns and applying them effectively improves
the flexibility and scalability of your Python projects.

## 17. Advanced Python Packaging

Packaging is essential in Python to distribute reusable and well-organized
code. Advanced packaging techniques help manage dependencies, automate builds,
and ensure compatibility across different platforms and Python versions.

### Packaging Tools

#### setuptools

`setuptools` is a must for modern Python packaging, offering powerful ways to
define project metadata, dependencies, and entry points. You can declare
dependencies in `setup.py`, and `setuptools` manages installations seamlessly.

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='mypackage',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'requests>=2.20',
        'numpy'
    ],
)
```

#### wheel

`wheel` is a binary package format that allows faster installations versus
source packages. To create a wheel, install `wheel` and run `python setup.py
bdist_wheel`.

#### twine

`twine` is used to upload packages securely to PyPI (Python Package Index).
Package authenticity is ensured using HTTPS and the verified PyPI repository.

```shell
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### Virtual Environments

Using virtual environments is crucial when deploying Python applications.
Tools like `venv` and `virtualenv` allow you to create isolated environments
with specific package dependencies, avoiding conflicts between projects.

```shell
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### Dependency Management

#### pip

`pip` is the standard tool for installing Python packages. You can manage
requirements using a `requirements.txt` file, ensuring consistent environments.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### poetry

`poetry` is a dependency management tool that also handles packaging, making
it easier to maintain `pyproject.toml` to define package requirements and the
project itself.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "my-package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A sample Python project"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
requests = "^2.25"

poetry install
```

Advanced Python packaging ensures smoother deployments and consistent
environments across systems, facilitating efficient distribution of Python
applications.
